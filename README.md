# Problem Description:
Many households, institutions and businesses require a reliable supply of gas cylinders for cooking and various other purposes. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that facilitates the supply and management of gas cylinders. The application should provide an efficient and seamless experience for users to view gas cylinder information varying from different brands, choosing which brand best suits them, interact with the system  and submit orders.

## Objectives:
- Develop a single-page web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an efficient and responsive user interface.
- Integrate with a db.JSON filethat provides data related to gas cylinder supply. Ensure that the communication between the client and the API is handled asynchronously using JSON.
Implement at least three separate event listeners to enhance user interactivity. Examples include a "like" button and form submissions for placing gas cylinder orders.

The application  entails a structure that follows;
1.	It will include a single HTML file (index.html) that contains the structure, while styles are defined in a CSS file (styles.css) and interactivity is managed through a JavaScript file (app.js).
2.	Data is retrieved asynchronously from a JSON file using the Fetch API in the “fetchDataFromApi” function. This function is called when the DOM content is loaded, ensuring that data is available for dynamic updates.
3.	Three separate event listeners are implemented to enhance user interaction.
4.	The HTML file includes sections for gas cylinder information display, interactive elements like buttons, and forms for user interactions.
5.	The code follows best practices, is well-organized, and adheres to the DRY (Do not repeat yourself) principle. Functions are used to encapsulate repetitive code, promoting maintainability and readability.
In conclusion, the Gas Cylinder Supply Web Application aims to provide an intuitive and interactive platform for users to access gas cylinder information, express preferences through events like button clicks, and submit orders. The project emphasizes a clean and efficient codebase, ensuring a positive user experience.
